  <p>"Edgar Karten were promotion postcards, 
  to be displayed in clubs and bars.
  Everyone could submit something to the Edgar 
  company and it was offered as a promotion 
  postcard in those displays. 99% of them 
  were some artistic stuff or funny slogans
  and graphics." - Don-Esteban</p>
