Gothic
In Gothic you don't have to determine everything before you start. Get to know the world a little before you have to decide: "You want to learn sorcery, eh? No problem son, just bring this message to the Necromancer and come back with his answer. If, err, when you get back, I'll teach you what you want to know."

You won't have to slog through thousands of menu screens, or have to keep a constant eye on a mass of character statistics. After all, it's much more fun to concentrate on the story and the world around you without being thrown off course by a few numbers.

Even though Gothic manages to survive without loads of menu screens and hundreds of character statistics, it will be no Action-RPG where RPG means that you get to open doors with golden keys instead of key-cards and kill orcs instead of super mutants.

The game is being developed by Pirahna Bytes.
