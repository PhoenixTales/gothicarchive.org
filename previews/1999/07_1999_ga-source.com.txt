Scheduled To Release: Q1 2000

I hate to keep bringing this game up, but what do you get when you mix role-playing elements with Tomb Raider? Tomb Raider 4? Nope. You get a game that is being developed by Piranha Bytes called Gothic. Yes, Gothic fuses the Tomb Raider-like gameplay with the depth of an RPG and some additional interesting twists. The game will be played from the third-person perspective with a 3D engine that features fully-modeled entities (players, NPCs, monsters, items, scenery), detailed enviroments, and some very nice texturing and lighting among other things. In addition, you don't enter the game as some high strung hero, but as a sentenced convict (for some unnamed crime) who must now fend for himself. Welcome to the world of Gothic.

Screenshot 1: Facial animations - Screenshot 2: An attacking orc - Screenshots 3: Features the center of the biggest location in the Gothic World, the Old Camp...btw, the character is walking on a grate, and there is a dark cellar with lots of cages, cells and dungeons down there.

What's Good: With the mixing of two popular genres, third-person adventures and role-playing, Gothic just might carve itself a niche. It has the depth without the complexity, and that's something gamers haven't seen in a while.
What's Bad: System requirements are pretty high - the projected minimum specs are: P2-300 with 64MB of RAM and a 3D accelerator.
