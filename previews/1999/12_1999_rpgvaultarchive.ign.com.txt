Gothic Screenshots

We received a note from the site telling us that six new Gothic screenshots can be seen today at GA-RPG. Gothic is a 3D real-time fantasy RPG being developed by German studio Piranha Bytes. Egmont Interactive will publish the game there. Nothing has been announced to date about a North American publisher.

Developers' Holiday Stocking Stuffers

With the holidays almost upon us, we thought it would be interesting and fun to ask some of our friends in the CRPG development community what they're hoping to find in their stockings this year.
Sascha Henrichs, a 3D Artist on the Gothic team at German developer Piranha Bytes, also has a long list:
-Fallout 2 (don't have it yet)
-some more programmers for our programmers team ;-)))
-a bit of freetime for my hobbies
-a korg prophecy synthesizer
-digital camera
-good news
Musician Kai Rosenkranz, also working on Gothic, figures a mere stocking won't be sufficient to hold what he'd like to receive:
There's a whole lot of stuff that I'm dreaming of, so it wouldn't fit into that holiday stocking. :-)
No, I don't expect anything, although I'm still searching for a way to finance my study. I cannot afford it for the moment yet, so maybe a scholarship or something would be great . . . Referring to the game there is only one thing that I hope. I hope that in the end it turns out to be as fantastic and successfull as we all expect it to be.
