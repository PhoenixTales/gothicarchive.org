Gothic Intelligence Report

The kingdom is at war against armies of invading orcs, and there is a desperate need for ore to forge into weapons. Even minor crimes are punished with hard labor in the mines. Ore is sent out in exchange for supplies, but what comes in is controlled by a powerful few, while the rest toil endlessly for the leftover scraps. Escape seems impossible, and peace is unlikely.

Such is the scenario for Gothic, the 3D fantasy action RPG currently in development at the German studio, Piranha Bytes. Expected to release next spring, it is an ambitious project with the potential to be a very interesting and perhaps even an exceptional title. Join us as we take an advance look at it in our Gothic Intelligence Report which includes some terrific new screenshots from the developers.

New Developer's Dreams At GA-Source

The occasional Developer's Dream feature at GA-Source has been updated with several more game makers' thoughts on what they'd make if there were no technological or monetary limitations. Alex Brueggemann of the Gothic team at Piranha Bytes offers this:
Think of TETRIS. Lots of restrictions, but a great game! I think you'll always need a set of rules (restrictions) for gameplay. Try to restrict it to pure fun! Without the technical restrictions a massive multiplayer game would be something I'd like to do. A mix of RPG, tactics and strategy. Much more emotions instead of just reactions. If you've seen Braveheart (the movie) you know what I mean. Games like Ultima Online, Everquest, Age of Empires II, Myth II, and WarCraft3 show the way.
Some of the other contributors include Alex' colleague Stefan Nyul, and Mark Rhodes and Dan Teasdale of Auran, developers of Harn: Bloodline. Follow the link for more.
