Gothic
======

Snow probably set some sort of record with this simply gigantic interview with Piranha Bytes, the guys behind the super-sweet 3D RPG, Gothic. We pretty much scored any and all of the information available! If you haven't heard about this killer game yet, it is definitely not one to pass up. Read On!

Game Asylum - Games aside, what other things have influenced Gothic's script, music, story, world, graphics, etc.?

Stefan - For my part, the "Eternal Champion"-novels of Micheal Moorcock made me love the dirty, ugly dark fantasy with dubious anti-heros slaying good as well as bad. I don't like fairy tale-fantasy with the noble knight in shining armour saving the lovely princess from an evil sorcerer.
