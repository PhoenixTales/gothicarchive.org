RPGHQ Interview: Gothic Team
============================

RPGHQ let us know they have posted a Gothic interview with members of the team at Piranha Bytes. The piece covers quite a bit of ground including these bits to pique your interest:
on the story: The story WILL definitely deal with ethics and morals. There are no goodies and baddies - most of the convicts are there because they committed a crime - but you will learn the slight differences between someone you can trust - at least for a few hours - and the REAL suckers :)

What I was talking about when I stated most rpgs were "so-called rpgs" is, that mostly, you don't actually have to play a role. The choice of your class is often only the choice of your weapons (do I kill with sword or fireball). But in GOTHIC, you will find people reacting differently, according to the gang you're in, the deeds you've done, or the power you have.
on psionic powers: Psionics can use telekinetic powers to attack or manipulate objects as well as psychokinetic powers to influence their enemies minds. As a psionic, you can take control of any humanoid being and use it to fight your enemies. But be careful! If your host dies - you will experience a shock! (It's no fun to FEEL your body being torn apart by a Minecrawler, even if its not actually your own)

Hit the link above to go to the beginning of the interview which also includes five new screenshots. It was recently announced that Gothic will be published by Germany's Egmont Interactive.
