New Gothic Screenshots
Yesterday, with the news that Gothic had found a publisher, team member Tom Putzki sent along a new screenshot from his 3D game. Maybe I was even more excited than Tom, but in any case, the shot didn't get posted with the story. With apologies to one and all, it is now available for your viewing pleasure right here along with six other new images. Enjoy!

Egmont Interactive To Publish Gothic

Earlier today, Tom Putzki of the Gothic development team at Germany's Piranha-Bytes let me in on some great news about his game:
GOTHIC has got a publisher!!!!
It's Egmont Interactive, located in Stuttgart, Germany. They are the multimedia and games sector of the international publisher EHAPA. Really cool guys. And they are totally crazy about GOTHIC! Hey, let the good times roll... ;-)
I've added a new shot from the surface world in GOTHIC, hope you like it!
Congratulations to Tom and the entire Piranha-Bytes team. Gothic is a 3D real-time fantasy RPG.
