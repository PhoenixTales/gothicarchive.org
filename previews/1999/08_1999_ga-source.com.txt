GA-Source Exclusive: Gothic Screenshots

Piranha-Bytes sent us the following new screenshots from their upcoming action/RPG, Gothic.

These are just some 'teaser shots' from the dungeons... other locations are still at work - Tom Putzki, Piranha-Bytes

Gothic fuses the Tomb Raider-like gameplay with the depth of an RPG and some additional interesting twists. The game will be played from the third-person perspective with a 3D engine that features fully-modeled entities (players, NPCs, monsters, items, scenery), detailed enviroments, and some very nice texturing and lighting among other things.
