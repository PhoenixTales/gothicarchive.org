3DGN Preview: Gothic

3DGaming.net has informed of their Gothic preview. Here's a snippet on NPCs and monsters:
The way AI and the NPCs work is also one of the more appealing features of the game. NPCs live and work like normal people. They'll sleep at night, wake up during the day (which you can watch them do), and get to work. Sometimes to get their attention you'll have to interrupt their activities and get them to talk. It's all about making a realistic world, and not only the NPCs will contribute to that. Monsters do their own things too. In many games, monsters stand in a single spot knowing full well you'll walk by and kill them. They don't mind though; they are too stupid to understand the concept. In Gothic, monsters will be working on their own things, and interacting amongst themselves. Disturb them, and face the consequences. Each enemy has certain dislikes or alliances with other enemies, which is something you'll need to learn before following an orc into a troll's cave only to have them team up and slaughter you.

Gothic Interview

Gothic is a 3D real-time fantasy role-playing game being developed by a German studio, Piranha Bytes. We have been in contact with the developers ever since we heard about the game last year, and have followed it's progress closely. Consequently, it was a pleasure to meet some of the team at E3, where we were also able to get our first look at Gothic aside from screenshots. In addition, we were able to arrange for an interview with four members of the team. Stefan Nyul is the Project Manager. Tom Putzki's responsibilities include PR and marketing plus game design while Alex Brueggemann's are game design and character animations, and Carsten Edenfeld is a programmer for the camera, sound and music et al.
