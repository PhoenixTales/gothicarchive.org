Gothic update - Sacrates
========================
Straight out of the cat's mouth comes an update from the bad asses working on Gothic. The Gothic Diary was updated with a bit of love for you to see. Also along those lines, scroll down all this news and at the bottom you'll notice that Game Asylum have left the loony house and scraped up a few shots of the game also.

Long time no see, long time no hear ;-)
But the PIRANHAs haven't been drowned like an eMail said ;-) We're crowded with work. We're working on a playable demo right now, several minutes of the finished game. This demo has to be cool. Really cool. But it takes a lot of time. But its worth it. During the next few days we're going to post several new screenshots, including the first outdoor shots. Looks pretty well right now. The first outdoor shot can also be seen in the German game magazin PC ACTION which voted us being amongst the ten best games expected this year. Thanks a lot guys.


Gothic goodness - Sacrates
==========================
Looks like the guys over at Game Asylum were slipping the guys working on Gothic some "under the counter" from a recent shipment of Gerbils. With all those gerbils, the Gothic guys got all happy and spewed off some brand spanking new screenshots of Gothic. Damn me! Next time, I do an interview with them, i'll ship off a case of exotic Arabian gerbils.
