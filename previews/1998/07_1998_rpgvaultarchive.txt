Gothic Update
=============
Tom Putzki of the Gothic design team just sent me the following information about their game and about some new screenshots.

"We're at the moment on publisher tour presenting GOTHIC and trying to find someone who's not only amazed and highly interested, but also wants to make a decision and says yes to GOTHIC and the PIRANHAs. We've visited 5 publishers right now, two more still to come. The first impressions were very good, now it's time for more intensive contact with our possible partners. Just waiting for the first offers to come.
The game is also going on...we've implemented several features like magic (fireball with nice SFX and the human control spell where you can take over any other character), we've got dynamic and colored light e.g. for torches, firebowls and firepillars. The SC is able to run with a torch in his hands and throw the torch away to light up places he can't reach; our first monsters like the Gobbo and the Troll are just interacting with each other - the Troll throws a Gobbo at hte SC over a canyon and so on.
I've just posted some new screenshots on our Homepage. O.k., hope that covers your interest for the moment.
Have a good time!"

Gothic is being developed by a new German company, Piranha Bytes.

More On Ultima And The Game Mags
================================
First off, thanks to Tom Putzki of the Gothic design team and to German readers Stefan vom Bruch and Wiggi who all confirmed reading the Gamestar article reported in yesterday's news. According to all three, the translation is accurate. Tom even sent me a scan of the article and a bit of information on Gamestar, which he describes as the second most popular German games magazine with sales of more than 200,000 copies per month.
