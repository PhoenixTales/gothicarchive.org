Gothic Update And Screenshots
=============================
Tom Putzki of the Gothic development team sent me a note to update us on what they've been up to, and also to let us know that some new 3dfx screenshots have been posted on their site:

"I've lost my voice on CeBIT Home last week, but it was a very cool event. Lots of talks, presentations and parties... ;-) Nothing very special right now, we're still working on and on and..... .btw, some new screenshots are posted on our webpage with a lot of action and magic and sfx. One of our programmers, Carsten, is doing a good job with the sound system right now. Monster design, modeling and animation is going on; we're working on a nice zombie right now. GOTHIC got it's second fanpage called GOTHIC Realms on http://gothic.realms.de/ O.k., that's it for the moment."

Gothic is being developed by a new German company, Piranha Bytes.
