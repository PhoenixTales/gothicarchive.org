Hordes of orcs have invaded your homeland, and the army needs a constant supply of weapons. Judged guilty of a minor crime, you have been swiftly and harshly punished, banished to a prison where the inmates toil to mine ore for the kingdom's forges. There are no guards here. None are required since the entire area is enclosed within a magical sphere, a barrier through which nothing living can leave. Will you survive the prison's dangers long enough to join one of the competing factions? Can there be any hope of escape?

Gothic is a real time 3D fantasy RPG currently in late development at German studio Piranha Bytes for publication this summer by Egmont Interactive following a successful showing at E3 last month. We first learned about the game a couple of years ago, and naturally, we've been tracking its progress ever since. With release drawing ever nearer, the team was kind enough to provide 13 new screenshots showing off the game, which we present in this Gothic Gallery.
