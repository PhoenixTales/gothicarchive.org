Gothic Set for Summer Release

A single-player RPG is in the works from Egmont and Piranha Bytes.

Egmont Interactive and Piranha Bytes plan to release Gothic for the PC in July 2000. According to the publisher, the single-player action-RPG title is set in a prison world and requires the player to survive in a hostile environment of competing factions. To do this, players must make allies and work their way up through the ranks of the organization by performing various tasks.
The game is expected to include an innovative and complex social environment, in which the players' actions will have a lasting effect on their alliances. Both the environment and the inhabitants are supposed to change over time, in some cases independent of the players' actions, which the developers feel will reduce the chance of playing the same situation twice. In addition, the motion-capture animation used in the game is expected to appeal to a wider audience than just RPG fans.

Egmont and Piranha plan to present the game at E3 in May.

This morning, Piranha Bytes and Egmont Interactive announced that they will release a 3D action-RPG called Gothic in the US this summer. The game will feature a fully interactive and consequential social system that affects the game as it progresses.
"I believe Gothic will experience great success with its cutting-edge graphics and the complete motion-captured animations of everything from the main character to NPCs and monsters - and any distractingly beautiful vixens you might meet in the game," said Egmont marketing manager Frank Delbrugge.

E3 attendees will be able to take a look at the game on the show floor, but we've lined up a few screenshots for you to enjoy now.
