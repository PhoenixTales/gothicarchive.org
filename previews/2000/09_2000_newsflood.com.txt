Exclusive Gothic shots

Let me tell you something about the guys from Piranha-Bytes. They are weirdos, but getting to know them at ECTS was fun. If you think those pictures are strange, the people actually look that way in real life. Check out Torsten's pic! Well anyways, thanks to him for sending us those 4 shots of their RPG game Gothic, which looks really cool.
