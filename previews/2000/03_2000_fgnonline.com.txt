Gothic's Movie Magic

PC: Tom Putzki, director of marketing for German developer Piranha Bytes has given FGN Online new details of its upcoming 3D action-RPG, Gothic. Click through for the scoop.

Gothic is slated for PC release in summer 2000, but could also be headed to PlayStation2 according to Putzki. "Egmont Interactive -- our publisher for Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Scandinavia -- has its own PlayStation development team in Scandinavia," he says. "We presented Gothic to them. Gothic is programmed and built up so that it will be easy to convert for PlayStation2, but of course this depends on our publisher."

Gothic's gameplay attempts to remain faithful to its title, as Putzki explains, "There is a functioning social system on the prison world where you begin the game, so you will be forced to take sides in certain situations. Almost everyone in the world is evil to some degree, similar to Escape From Manhattan with Kurt Russell -- the first one of course not the second one.

"This gothic-fantasy scenario means that everyone in this prison world is trying to survive. They join one of several gangs that rival each other, and the player is thrown into this prison world. Events in the world take place whether the player's in it or not, and so the player has to react to how the world is functioning and not the other way round."
