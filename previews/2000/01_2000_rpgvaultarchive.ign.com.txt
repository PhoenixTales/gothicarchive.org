Stefan Nyul (Gothic) Profile At blinkingdot
Another ad personem interview has been posted today at blinkingdot. This one introduces Stefan Nyul, Producer of Gothic, currently in development at Piranha Bytes. These are this thoughts on the future of CRPGs:
Online and Mainstream. Online, because involving REAL human characters can hardly be beaten by AI. Mainstream, because the traditionally / classical CRPG is to complex to fascinate huge numbers of players. Even hardcore-CRPG-players will love the easy-to-handle-and-yet-full-depth-CRPGs of the next generation. Also read Warren Spectors articles in the Game Developers Magazine about CRPGs!
