  <h1><a href="../">../</a> 20th Anniversary Special</h1>
  
  <p>At the beginning of this year, I made a journey to Mike Hoge, the father of GOTHIC. It was an honour to talk to him about the old vision of the game that we present in this archive, in order to make the dream come true in project <a href="https://phoenixthegame.com">PHOENIX</a>. He gave me his old design folders, such that I could digitise them for the 20th anniversary. You can read everything about this journey in my essay <a href="https://phoenixthegame.com/specials/20thAnniversaryEssay.html">'Phoenix and the Rescue of Design'</a>.</p>

  <p>GOTHIC was released on march 15th 2001 in Germany. We celebrate the 20th anniversary of GOTHIC for 30 days starting today. Every day we try to release something that we have prepared and a lot of new things from Gothic's design process never seen before. In some cases, the creator's approval is still pending. Therefore, we cannot promise that we will be able to show you everything that we want on time. There may be delays, but we do our best. Better late than never. Everything will be fine.</p>

  <p>I have digitised the documents page by page and adjusted every page by hand. They were mostly unstructured. I have given them a new order and I have tried to do them justice in our presentation on the archive here. I think that the material that we are about to release is of historical value and no matter how much you may value it, it is of great help for us and the Gothic Alpha Reboot we are working on.</p>
  
  <p>I want to thank Mike Hoge and Tom Putzki for the material and for their ongoing support. Enjoy. - flosha</p>
