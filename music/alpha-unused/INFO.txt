KaiRo was asked in general about his
permission to publish and use old pieces
of music made by him. He said that he is
okay with that, but couldn't say anything
officially; therefore in addition 
Megalomaniac was asked. He is responsible 
at THQ Nordic. The reply of KaiRo was 
shown to him. He approved by saying: 
"if Kai approves, I approve!"

Since I knew about this approval, 
I can finally publish these tracks,
which were never released before.

They are part of our Soundtrack for
Phoenix too, where we remix them
and combine them with later tracks.
Have fun. - flosha
