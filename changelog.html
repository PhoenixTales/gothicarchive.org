  <h1>[GothicArchive]<br>
    <strong>CHANGELOG</strong><br>
    &copy; PhoenixTales</h1>
  
  <p><strong>TODO LIST</strong>; help is appreciated:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add the remaining reviews from <a href="https://forum.worldofplayers.de/forum/threads/1532284-G1-%D0%A5%D0%A0%D0%9E%D0%9D%D0%9E%D0%9B%D0%9E%D0%93%D0%98%D0%AF-%D0%93%D0%9E%D0%A2%D0%98%D0%9A%D0%90-1/page5?p=26021208&viewfull=1#post26021208">Odins chronology</a></li>
    <li>Collect and add all post-release interviews</li>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.worldofgothic.de/spirit/">Spirit of Gothic</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.gothicz.net/">gothicz.net</a></li>
        <li>etc.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Fix english version of gothicthegame.com</li>
    <li>Add Sources to research/inspirations.txt</li>
    <li>Add Sequel News to postrelease/</li>
    <li>Include Sequel Research</li>
    <li>Fix the Version Nr's in the Graphical Screenshot Links</li>
    <li>Fix the Screenshots ordered by time according to Flatcher's Archive, but without renaming original files(!) as he did. Also: Right now we have most screenshots two times in the archive, for those ordered by time and those ordered by location. This was necessary for me, obviously, to order them and to create those html-files in the first place. But now, after they are created, the doubled screenshots can and should be removed from the archive to make it a bit smaller. It should be done in the following way: First compare Flatchers archive with floshas archive (ordered by time), order it according to Flatchers structure, but use the original files with their original dates and file names from floshas archive. Then look at all the screenshots in orderedbylocation/, remove everything which is is copy of a screenshot in orderedbytime etc. Then change the links to the screenshots in orderedbylocation.html and direct them to the orderedbytime-screens. Then we have them all ordered by time and version both in folders and in html documents, but we also have them ordered by location in form of the html document.</li>
    <li>Get the permission to include the Comic</li>
    <li>Add the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070906105353/http://www.ipp-world.de/auftragscomics-de/gothic-de/#">Comic Page</a> from Ideenschmiede Paul & Paul</li>
    <li>Add/reconstruct Vadims Gothic pages (<a href="http://www.spellcraft.de/html/d_main_old_games_gothic.htm">old</a> & <a href="http://www.spellcraft.de/html/resume_cv_gothic.htm">new</a>)</li>
    <li>Improve the "Evolution of the Hud" Page</li>
    <li>Fix the Version database by Vaana</li>
    <li>Add the four ((?) could be more) new screenshots released by Don-Esteban from Ralfs archive</li>
    <li>Add all of Vaanas Screenshot Comparisons as GIFS in comparisons/ (!)</li>
    <li>Include a better Classes-Comparison (and move the new pics for this purpuse from classes to comparisons/)</li>
    <li>Include an (assumed) Hero-Face Comparison</li>
