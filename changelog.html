  <p><strong>TODO LIST (How you can help)</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add the remaining reviews from <a href="https://forum.worldofplayers.de/forum/threads/1532284-G1-%D0%A5%D0%A0%D0%9E%D0%9D%D0%9E%D0%9B%D0%9E%D0%93%D0%98%D0%AF-%D0%93%D0%9E%D0%A2%D0%98%D0%9A%D0%90-1/page5?p=26021208&viewfull=1#post26021208">Odins chronology</a></li>

    <li>Add Sources to research/inspirations.txt</li>
    <li>Add Sequel News to postrelease/</li>
    <li>Include Sequel Research</li>
    <li>Fix the Version Nr's in the Graphical Screenshot Links</li>
    <li>Fix the Screenshots ordered by time according to Flatcher's Archive, but without renaming original files(!) as he did. Also: Consider, that the screenshots are duplicated in the archive right now, we have most screenshots two times in the archive, ordered by time and ordered by location; they should contain the same amount of screenshots and the same files obviously, but ordered differently. It was necessary for me to structure them in separate folders to order them and to create the respective html-files in the first place. Now it may seem unnecessary to have these duplicates, we could just change the links of the location screenshots inside the html documents to the version ones and delete the location folders; but it is just about 160 MB additional data and I consider it helpful to have them ordered both ways if you watch the archive locally. The merge with Flatcher's Archive should be done the following way: First compare Flatchers archive with floshas archive (ordered by time), order it according to Flatchers structure, but use the original files with their original dates and file names from floshas archive. Then look at all the screenshots in orderedbylocation/ and replace them in their respective folders with copies of the version/time screens (always prefer the older/original/high quality screen with the original filename). Then we have them all ordered by time/version and location both in folders and in html documents.</li>
    <li>Get the permission to include the Comic</li>
    <li>Add the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070906105353/http://www.ipp-world.de/auftragscomics-de/gothic-de/#">Comic Page</a> from Ideenschmiede Paul & Paul</li>
