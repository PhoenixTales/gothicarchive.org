Altered Gothic
==============	
[ Delekhan ]

Those wacky lads at Altered Worlds have posted an interview with Piranha Bytes, the German developers of an upcoming 3D RPG entitled Gothic. Here's a blurb describing the setting for the game:

"...we wanted to create a Fantasy-scenario that was dark and hostile (and no colorful fairy-tale-adventure). A Prison full of cutthroats seemed rather appropriate. Secondly, we needed to limit the size of the world, therefore we planned to place the prison on an island, but then we decided in favor of the magic barrier, because it emphasizes the feeling of being imprisoned. Our goal to create a real, living world would have never been achieved if we would have had to display too many characters - in GOTHIC, therefore there are "only" over 200 NPCs, each of them with his/her own character, behaviour, name, skills, friends, background story and more."
