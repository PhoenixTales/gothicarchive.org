    <h2>Arnold Böcklin</h2>
    <img src="inspirations/boecklin/boecklin5.png" alt="Arnold Böcklin Painting 1">

    <p>Arnold Böcklin (1827-1901) was an inspiration for Ralf. Avallach collected various paintings by him as reference images for Kharynic and Phoenix. We do not know for sure if they served as an inspiration for Gothic, but we show them here because they fit the dark and mystic atmosphere and color schemes they strived for:</p>

    <p>"His paintings bore the influences of classical and Renaissance art and the Mediterranean landscape. His compositions show these new influences through allegorical and mythological themes. In his paintings, Böcklin created a strange, brooding fantasy world, populated by fantastical figures. His best known artworks are the five versions of 'Isle of the Dead' [german: Die Toteninsel] (1880–1886)."</p>

    <p>This isle of the dead Ralf took as an inspiration for his Island of Resurrection ["Erweckungsplatz"], an early, discarded idea for the game.</p>

    <h2>Albert Bierstadt</h2>
    <p>Another artist of which Avallach collected reference images and by which the Gothic designers may have been inspired too, is Albert Bierstadt. Here are some of his works:</p>

    <h2>Thomas Cole</h2>
    <p>The third artist on our list of possible influences is Thomas Cole. This are some of his works, once again collected by Avallach:</p>

    <h2>Boris Vallejo</h2>

    <p><a href="https://www.borisjulie.com/">Boris Vallejo</a> was an inspiration for Uwe Meier.
    The Waran Princess (on the left) was created as a hommage to Vallejos work (on the right), as pointed out by Don-Esteban.</p>

    <!-- Der letzte Detektiv -->
    <h2>Der letzte Detektiv - Strafkolonie</h2>
    <img src="inspirations/lastdetective.jpg" alt="Der letzte Detektiv">
    <p>ThielHater found out that there are many parallels between the 27th episode ("Strafkolonie") from 3th March 1994 of the radio play "Der letzte Detektiv" (by Michael Koser) and GOTHIC (2001). <a href="https://forum.worldofplayers.de/forum/threads/828598-Verschw%C3%B6rung-Gothic-1-alles-nur-geklaut">Read more about his findings here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Judge Death</h2>
    <img src="inspirations/judgedeath.gif" alt="A comparison of the royal demon hunter armor and Judge Death">
    <p>A sequel designer might have been inspired by <em>Judge Death</em> from the <em>Judge Dredd</em> comics, when he made the royal demon hunter armor. - Florian</p>
