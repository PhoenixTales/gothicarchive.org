    which can be seen in the night sky texture of Gothic Vanilla.</p>

    might be not, but I couldn't oversee it. -lali</p>

  <!-- Gomez' Armor -->
  <img src="secrets/gomez.gif" alt="Reference armor for Gomez' armor design">
  <p>Don-Esteban found this armor which was most likely the model for the

  <p>We expect the inscription on this sword texture to be:<br>

  <!-- Hidden Messages -->
  <h3>Hidden Orcish Messages</h3>
  <img src="secrets/Alphabet.png" alt="Orcish Alphabet/Runes">

  <p>As seen above, Mike had developed an orcish alphabet in the design process of Gothic. A fan <a href="../postrelease/fonts/OrcRunes.ttf">created a font</a> out of it. The following Messages you can find inside the game, they were translated by Flatcher Goth:</p>

  <img src="secrets/orcish/113506.png" alt="Runes saying 'Gateway'">
  <p>The above runes say: "Gateway".</p>

  <img src="secrets/orcish/113418.png" alt="Runes saying 'Peace'">
  <p>These signs say: "Peace".</p>

  <img src="secrets/orcish/113115.png" alt="Runes saying 'Beware'">
  <p>Here is written: "Beware".</p>

  <img src="secrets/orcish/113446.png" alt="Runes saying 'Gefahr', german for 'Danger'">
  <p>And here: "Gefahr".</p>

  <img src="secrets/orcish/113103.png" alt="Runes saying 'Horst'">
  <p>On this orcish weapon is written: "Horst".</p>

  <img src="secrets/orcish/31670-.png" alt="Runes saying 'Action Adventure Game'">
  <p>And these runes on the english Cover say: Action Adventure Game.</p>

  <h3>Handbook Easteregg</h3>
  <img src="secrets/handbookeasteregg.png" alt="A hidden message in the handbook of Gothic">
  <p>When you examine the german handbook cover and look carefully, you will see a message. I cannot decipher everything, but: "Magier sollten sich am Eingang zum...", which means: "Mages should ... themselves at the entrance."</p>

  <p>I had no .psd of the manual or didn't consider it. But Nex took a deeper look and found not only more of this message, but other messages too. I've inverted the colour for our black background here:</p>

  <img src="secrets/manual/2M5NAdC-invert.png" alt="'Sechs Magier sollten sich am Eingang zum alten Tal ...'">
  <img src="secrets/manual/eL4PhZx-invert.png" alt="'com Cililia ter vicentoribus'">
  <img src="secrets/manual/g0ZMaIT-invert.png" alt="'24/15/8654/16' 'COONOFICAT'">
  <img src="secrets/manual/MU0TZD8-invert.png" alt="Schläfers Macht sei nicht">

  <p>On the third one is written: "'24/15/8654/16' 'COONOFICAT'". No idea what the meaning could be. We also do not know what the meaning of the second one is or what the mages are supposed to do at the entrance to the valley. It all may have no deeper meaning. But interesting nonetheless.</p>

  <!-- Marvin, 42, What was the question? -->
  <h3>Cheat Mode</h3>
  <p>In Gothic you activate the Cheat-Mode by typing 'Marvin' inside the
    character screen. Marvin is also the name of a Cut NPC from the Alpha. You
    deactive the Cheat-Mode by typing '42' inside the character screen, which is
    the answer of the Supercomputer from 'The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy'.
    And when deactivated, a text is printed: "What was the question?"</p>
  <p>You can find the cheat codes <a href="https://www.worldofgothic.de/gothic/gothic_cheats.htm">here</a>.</p>
