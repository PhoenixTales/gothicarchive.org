Dear community,

with version 0.9 I conclude my work on the Archive 
to focus on the creation of Phoenix. I want to thank 
everyone who helped me and contributed to the Archive 
so far. I will continue to maintain it, but if you 
want the archive to change, please do so yourself.

-> Thus, from now on, the Archive will be on GitHub. 
I lay it into your hands to further improve it. 

Version 1.0 is intended for the day at which we can 
legally include all material that is out there, all 
the builds, the comic, the demos, design documents, 
the sourcecode and so on. This is not yet possible, 
but it may be someday.
